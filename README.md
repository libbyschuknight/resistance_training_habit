# Resistance Training Habit App

I am obsessed with surfing. I go surfing whenever I can.

To get better at surfing when there is no surf, I need to build up my strength.

The plan is to do this via a resistance training program. But, I haven't got into a good habit with
doing training sessions regularly.

I use a tool called Precision Nutrition around eating habits and I'm pretty good at it.

I'm planning on trying to create something similar, but different.

I am also using this as an opportunity to learn new tech things. This Rails app is going to be a
bit of a playground to test ideas and whip things up quickly.

I am also planning on creating a Rails API app and a React app and then connect them together, as I
want to learn more about APIs and React.

Let's see how I go! 😁 😱
